                In terms of FC Barcelona, the club’s history can be clearly be divided into three main stages.
                In the early days, the club constantly switched between different grounds. In the second stage, the club was consolidated by finding a permanent home at Les Corts. And the third stage, and the construction of the Camp Nou, reflects the expansion and grandeur of the club on a 
                global scale.
                The old Les Corts ground, inaugurated in 1922, was remodelled several times in order to find room for Barça’s constantly growing fan base. After the Spanish Civil War, the club started attracting more and more members every year, which also meant a considerably larger number 
                of spectators at matches.
                This increased support was the inspiration for several expansion projects, of the south goal (1946), the north goal (1950), and the grandstand’s capacity (1944). But it was becoming patently evident that what the club really needed to do was build a completely new stadium, and therefore the board of directors combined these improvements to Les Corts with plans to make the dream of a new stadium a reality.

                THE CONSTRUCTION (1954-57)
            </div>
            <div class="texttext">
                The architects of the new stadium were Francesc Mitjans Miró, cousin of Miró-Sans, and Josep Soteras Mauri, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García Barbón. More than a year later, on July 11, 1955, the club commissioned the construction work to the INGAR SA company, who estimated the project at 66,620,000 pesetas, claiming it would take 18 months to complete. However, the stadium would eventually cost an awful lot more than the original estimate, eventually totalling around 288 million pesetas, an amount that would need to be covered by successive issues of mortgage obligations ((100 million pesetas) and short term bonds (60 million pesetas). This measure meant the construction of the stadium could be financed, but would leave the club in heavy debt for many years after.

                THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STADIUM FROM 1957
            </div>
            <div class="texttext">
                When it was opened Camp Nou had a capacity of 93,053 (the old project for a capacity of 150,000 had been abandoned) and the pitch measured 107x72 metres (it currently measures 105x68 to fulfill UEFA requirements). The principal materials used in its construction were iron and concrete and since 1957 the stadium has undergone several refurbishments.
                Amongst the most notable were the installation of floodlighting in 1959, the arrival of the electronic scoreboard in 1976 and the construction of the VIP area and press box which came during the 1981/82 season.
                EXTENSION IN 1982
                In 1982 the stadium’s capacity was increased by 22,150 with the addition of the third tier of seating, giving Camp Nou room for some 115,000 fans. The stadium played host that year to the opening ceremony and first game of the World Cup. Two years later in 1984 the Club Museum was added to the stadium.
                In 1994, more work was carried out as the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres to allow the lower seating area to be expanded, the conversion of standing areas behind the goals into seated areas and the removal of the moat from around the pitch.
                Before the century was out the standing areas were turned into seating thus reducing the stadium’s capacity to its present day figure of 99,000.
